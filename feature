Given an integer number n, you need to find the maximum number of right angled triangles where the maximum length of the triangles <= n.

Assuming the lengths of the 3 sides of a possible triangle is a, b, c, then

1 <= a <= b <= c <= n
a^2 + b^2 = c^2
a, b, c, n are all integers
If there is no possible right angled triangles, return 0.

n is in the range of [1,9999]
